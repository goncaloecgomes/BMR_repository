    "Here the main code structure and functionalities aim to be detailed so as to gain an understanding in the underlying structure behind the Thymio implementations. Generally speaking, the code can be split into 3 main parts, namely Camera Vision, Global Navigation and Local Navigation. Camera Vision is used to generate the shortest path the thymio should take to go from its current position to a defined goal, taking into consideration existing obstacles, and to localize the thymio on the during run time. Glabal Navigation includes the functions that find the thymio and generate the shortest path from computer vision, as well as the implementation of a PID controller to make the thymio follow the desired path, and the implementation of a Kalman Filter to estimate the Thymio's states from the sensor measurements. The latter includes all aspects related to obstacle avoidance, which was iteratively tuned to obtain desired performance. One important element to consider prior to delving into the implemented functionalities within the code would be the chosen environment setup for the final project implementation. Indeed, it was decided to use one of the team member's lower wardrobe portion so as to benefit from a relatively \"stable\" environment, which could further simplifiy the calibration, lighting and initial setup process. This environment does however come with its limitations, as this implies that the Thymio must navigate in a restricted and confined space, namely implying that the local navigation must take that into account (i.e walls and corners must be accounted for) and yield a relatively high responsiveness."

    "The Local Navigation for this project was implemented as a class in order to be able to benefit from conciceness and structure. Local_Nav takes as an input the asynchronous client, the awaited node and finally the motor speeds. The constructor then defines the \"self\" variables which are to be used throughout the different methods, which proves to be particularly useful as it is readily able to update the values which are to be sent to the thymio (through the node). \n",
    "\n",
    "The main class method is obstacle_avoidance and is structured as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "The get_sensor_data(self) method gathers horizontal proximity sensor readings at each timestep, which is \"fed\" into the analyse_data(self) method. The latter returns a flag = 1 if any of the read values were higher than the lower threshold (iteratively deduced to be worth 2800), at which point the obstacle avoidance manoeuvres are returned. From there, depending on which sensors were triggered, the resulting motor speeds are adjusted by means of a weighted gain and directly updated through the ''' self.node.send_set_variables(adjust_speed) ''' command. It ought to be mentioned that three gains (ranging from low to high) were implemented depending on the intensity of the sensed values. Furthermore, the gains are obtained through and average of the extremity sensors and the \"mid-extremity\" sensors (the ones in between the front middle and each extremity). This allows to single handedly capture most of the real-case scenarios, as testing showed that the Thymio could be as likely to encounter any of the three following scenarios : \n",
    "\n",
    "- Only the extremity sensors being triggered\n",
    "- Only the mid-extremity sensors being triggered\n",
    "- A combination of both\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, this implementation of the gains allows some flexbility in the manoeuvering should an obstacle be encountered. Regarding the lower threshold of 2800, this was initially set to be of lower value (i.e 1500) but unfortunately proved to be too  sensitive to the walls in the confined environment that the Thymio operated in. To amend to this, the walls were covered in relatively dark material so as to decrease the sensitivity of the sensors.\n",

    "In order to reach it's goal, the Thymio must convert the difference between it's current position and orientation and that of it's goal into a control action. A PID controller is used here which produces a control action that is proportional to this difference, damped so that the control action does not oscillate due to overshooting and corrected for accumulated errors. This method was chosen over a simpler proportional control as it was found through testing that the damping and error correction provided by the derivative and integral terms are necessary for the Thymio to navigate with higher precision in the limited space available to us. The gains for the controller are initialised in the code cell below along with other variables that are used in the calculation of the control action. The values of **Kp**, **Kd** and **Ki** were found through manual tuning of the controller until a desired output was shown. The **previous_error** is used to calculate the error difference between time steps and hence the damping term. The **error_sum** is used to calculate the accumulated error, hence being the integrative term.\n",

This function takes as input the angle between a vector that goes from the Thymio to the goal, and a vector aligned with the Thymio's currect orientation. The output of the function is the angular velocity of the left and right wheels of the Thymio which are sent to the Thymio at each timestep. The goal of the function is to minimise the angle, thought of as the error, thus turning the Thymio towards the goal. The error is converted to an angular velocity by applying the gains as described in the equation below. To create the control action, the angular velocity of each wheel is described in terms of a design speed and the angular velocity created by the error. The error term is added or subtracted to the design speed of each wheel so as to have an opposite effect on each wheel thereby causing the Thymio to rotate in order to minimise the error and move the Thymio toward the goal at the design speed. \n",

    "In complex systems such as mobile robots, the state of the sysem is almost impossible to determine with complete accuracy. Sensor data of the system can be used to provide a better estimation of the system state and typically the data is passed through a filter when the variables of interest cannot be measured directly. In the case of the Thymio, its position and orientation can be reliably found using the camera but, when the camera is obscured or for some reason it does not find the thymio in a given frame, we must rely on the Thymio motor speed sensors to infer the new position and orientation at each timestep. Several types of filter exist but the Kalman filter is widely used in robotics for tracking and prediction applications as it is well suited to systems with uncertainty about an observable dynamic process i.e. the motor speeds. \n",

    "The Kalman filter is programmed as a recursive function using the estimated state from the previous time step and the sensor data to estimate the current state. At each time step the state transition matrix **A** is used to predict the state variables at the current time step from their previous values. The state covariance **P**, initialised as **P0**, is also predicted using **A**. The observed sensor data at the current time step is then used to calculate the Kalman gain in conjunction with the error in the measurement **R** and the error in the estimate **Q**. Finally the Kalman gain is used to update the prediction of the state and the covariance towards a belief that lies between the initial prediction and the measurement.\n",

The covariance function used to create the covariance matrices can also be found in this file. The state transition matrix **A** is constructed so as to progress the coordinates and orientation of the Thymio by a single timestep given their previous rates of change. The covariance matrices are constructed so that each diagonal element is an error corresponding to the state variable which it relates to. The initial values chosen for Q and P0 were based on from the sample values given in the Week 8 Exercise session on Kalman filter implementation and have proved to be sufficient. The values for R were iteratively tuned."

    "Camera vision is used to find the shortest path from the Thymio to the goal. This is implemented in the get_shortest_path function within the Global_Nav class. This function takes as input an image of the environment and the size of the thymio. First the function locates the thymio within the image using a QR code mounted on its back. The image is then converted into greyscale and the Canny edge detection algorithm is used to convert the image into a virtual environment containing only the contours. The OpenCV function cv.Canny() is used for this purpose as it also reduces noise in the image by applying a 5x5 Gaussian filter before applying the edge detection algorithm itself. The image must be put through the Gaussian filter first as edge detection is highly susceptible to noise. \n",

It is necessary to wait until after the image is converted before attempting to locate the corners as the sharper edges and clearer colour boundaries allow the function to be more accurate. The Harris corner detection algorithm is used here as it is easily available from the OpenCV library and has been proven to be reasonably reliable.\n",

Ultimately it was decided to use Dijkstra's algorithm as it is conveniently available from the pyvisgraph library. However, since the thymio is considered as a point for the purposes of path finding, the positions of the corners in the image must be augmented to prevent the thymio from colliding with the obstacles. This is simply achieved by scaling the polygons by the thymio size. "
