    "Here the main code structure and functionalities aim to be detailed so as to gain an understanding in the underlying structure behind the Thymio implementations. Generally speaking, the code can be split into 3 main parts, namely Camera Vision, Global Navigation and Local Navigation. The latter includes all aspects related to obstacle avoidance, which was iteratively tuned to obtain desired performance. \n",
    "One important element to consider prior to delving into the implemented functionalities within the code would be the chosen environment setup for the final project implementation. Indeed, it was decided to use of of the team member's lower cupboard portion so as to benefit from a relatively \"stable\" environment, which could further simplifiy the calibration, lighting and initial setup process. This environment does however come with its limitations, as this implies that the Thymio must navigate in a restricted and confined space, namely implying that the local navigation must take that into account (i.e white walls and corners must be accounted for) and yield a relatively high response rate without interfering with the global navigation tasks.

    "The Local Navigation for this project was implemented as a class in order to be able to benefit from conciceness and structure. Local_Nav takes as an input the asynchronous client, the awaited node and finally the motor speeds. The constructor then defines the \"self\" variables which are to be used throughout the different methods, which proves to be particularly useful as it is readily able to update the values which are to be sent to the thymio (through the node). \n",
    "\n",
    "The main class method is obstacle_avoidance and is structured as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "The get_sensor_data(self) method gathers horizontal proximity sensor readings at each timestep, which is \"fed\" into the analyse_data(self) method. The latter returns a flag = 1 if any of the read values were higher than the lower threshold (iteratively deduced to be worth 2800), at which point the obstacle avoidance manoeuvres are returned. From there, depending on which sensors were triggered, the resulting motor speeds are adjusted by means of a weighted gain and directly updated through the ''' self.node.send_set_variables(adjust_speed) ''' command. It ought to be mentioned that three gains (ranging from low to high) were implemented depending on the intensity of the sensed values. Furthermore, the gains are obtained through and average of the extremity sensors and the \"mid-extremity\" sensors (the ones in between the front middle and each extremity). This allows to single handedly capture most of the real-case scenarios, as testing showed that the Thymio could be as likely to encounter any of the three following scenarios : \n",
    "\n",
    "- Only the extremity sensors being triggered\n",
    "- Only the mid-extremity sensors being triggered\n",
    "- A combination of both\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, this implementation of the gains allows some flexbility in the manoeuvering should an obstacle be encountered. Regarding the lower threshold of 2800, this was initially set to be of lower value (i.e 1500) but unfortunately proved to be too  sensitive to the walls in the confined environment that the Thymio operated in. To amend to this, the walls were covered in relatively dark material so as to decrease the sensitivity of the sensors.\n",
